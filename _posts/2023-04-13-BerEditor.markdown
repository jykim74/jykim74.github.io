This tool is capable of editing  and viewing for BER and DER  data.
BerEditor is ASN.1 viewer.


In addition, there are PKI-related functions such as encryption/decryption, signing/verification, OTP generation, BigNum calc and viewing OID values required for PKI or crypto development.

And it supports reading and editing TTLV encoding format, which is the protocol format for KMIP.

The size is about 29M.
