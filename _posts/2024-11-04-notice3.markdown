Hello. I am a JayKim developer.

For the BerEditor, CertMan, and CryptokiMan programs provided here,
30-day licenses are issued [here] (https://jykim74.github.io/notice/2024/04/22/notice3.html, "License Issue" )
Please note that licenses are issued free of charge to anyone, and those who have already received them can continue to receive them.

The license issuance link is not Tistory, but a web hosting server.
(Tistory does not process backend.)

Since there were not many users, I did not know that there were errors,
but I recently found out that some people are experiencing license-related errors..
If you have any questions or inquiries, please send a message to [GoogleGroups] ( https://groups.google.com/g/bereditor, "Google Groups" ) or my email jykim74@gmail.com.
Please let me know the error-related message.

Currently, I have responded to the expected problems..
There may be other problems, so if you send me a message to identify the problem,
it will help me solve the problem.

Licenses can only be issued online.
If you have difficulty issuing online, please send an email to jykim74@gmail.com. Then I will send you the license as a file so that you can process it.

Thank you.
