When I work on PKI, I encounter problems with cryptography and mathematical knowledge.
Cryptology is a field of mathematics, so it is actually a difficult field for developers with backgrounds in electronic computing.
As a result, it seems that the development of cryptography itself is mainly done by mathematicians.
 
In fact, when developing PKI-related development, it is necessary to use cryptographic algorithms.
It is common to use a well-crafted cryptographic source rather than creating your own cryptography functions.

As a result, mathematical understanding is only a concept
It develops because it memorizes the characteristics of the encryption algorithms.
 
If the mathematical operations don't work, I have no mathematical understanding.
Causes and bugs become problems that are too difficult to fix.
So, to solve the problem, we use a proven library
Determine the error of wrong operation through comparison with the verified library

So a verified library is important.
In my case, I use OpenSSL as a verification function, but the function of simple encryption itself is not enough.
OpenSSL considers that encryption-related sources have been verified.

Of course, that doesn't mean that OpenSSL itself isn't without problems at all ^^;

Because of my lack of mathematical understanding,
While verifying using OpenSSL, I made various tools.
