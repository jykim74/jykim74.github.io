I also organize the knowledge, functions, and libraries that I have learned about PKI so far.
This is because I can freely create the functions I want to make and perform various tests.
And as time goes by, I can't remember it, so if I leave it as a program like this, I can look it up at any time.
But as I kept making it, it became too big to manage.

Since I spent some time alone making it, I even thought about making a manual.
Now I have a lot of work to fix bugs while testing ^^;
However, I updated the version after a while..

Still, I hope someone uses it well...
