Linux 64-bit BerEditor CertMan CryptokiMan is supported (zip format) BerEditor, CertMan and CryptokiMan are supported on Linux.
The current test Linux is Ubuntu 20 version and is 64-bit.
The executable file was compressed and uploaded as a zip file.
After unzipping the zip file, you can run the executable sh file.

Currently, I don't know if it works well other than my development environment.
If you use it, please let me know the Linux environment you are using (in the comments or on the bulletin board below).

The Linux version is actually lacking in testing, so if there are any problems or problems,
please use the bulletin board below. Please let me know at the link.
