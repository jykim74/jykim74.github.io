BerEditor, CertMan and CryptokiMan tools were only supported on Windows 64bit.
DMG file for MAC OS has also been uploaded.

You can mount the DMG file on MAC and move the app to the /Applications folder to use it.

It may be unstable because it has not yet been sufficiently tested in the MAC environment.
Also, I don't know if the M1 chip MacBook for MAC works because I haven't used it.

I would appreciate it if anyone who had run it in M1 would let me know if it works ^^
